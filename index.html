      <!-- ABOUT ME -->
      <h2 class="bio-title">About Me</h2> 
      <p class="bio-text">&#8195;I am a <strong>Computer Science student at Texas Tech University</strong>, I am dedicated and passionate about my field of study. I joined Texas Tech in 2021 after completing two years at South Plains College. I am excited to share that I will <i>graduate in May 2024</i> with a <strong>Bachelor of Science in Computer Science</strong> and a <strong>minor in Mathematics</strong>. I look forward to starting my technical career and applying my skills and knowledge.</p>
      <p class="bio-text">&#8195;My love for problem-solving and innovation drives me in the tech world, along with my interest in video game development and design. I am passionate about creating solutions to real-world problems and pushing the boundaries of technology.</p>
      <p class="bio-text">&#8195;Please feel free to explore my portfolio to see my projects and get a sense of my work. <em>If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, please don't hesitate to get in touch!</em></p>

    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>&#8195;I live in Lubbock, Texas, where I was born and raised. I have a cat named <span class="loaf-hover">Loaf<img src="imgs/Loaf.jpg" alt="Loaf" class="loaf-img"></span>, who often sits on my desk as I write code. I enjoy cooking delicious food, and even recently challenged myself to try a plant-based lifestyle. Considering this, you could assume that I am an environmentally conscious individual. This is true. I even purchased an electric bike, which is now my primary mode of transportation and my way of attempting to cut back on my carbon emissions.</p>
    <p>&#8195;I have always been passionate about video games, both as a player and as a creator. I grew up playing games like Super Mario, Skyrim, and Last of Us. I was amazed and captivated by the immersive worlds and stories they offered to my (sometimes) monotonous life. This fascination gave me an urge to understand how high quality and immersive video games were made, and what kind of skills and tools were involved in their process of making. That curiosity and passion led me to pursue a degree in computer science at Texas Tech University, where I excelled in both academic and extracurricular activities. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in programming languages, data structures, algorithms, and software engineering. I also participated in several hackathons and student-led computer science clubs, where I collaborated with other students to create innovative solutions for real-world challenges.</p> 
    <p>&#8195;My goal is to become a software engineer who can design, develop, and deploy cutting-edge applications that address real-world problems. I am particularly interested in working on projects that involve artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing, because I believe these are the future of technology. I am also very open to any video game developer positions, an industry of entertainment in which I believe I can make an impact with my skills and creativity. I have thus far created and contributed to two games, one in Godot & the other in Unreal engine. I am always eager to learn new things and improve my craft, and I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or questions!</p>
